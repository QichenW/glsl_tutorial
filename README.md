glsl_lighting
=============

This is an OpenGL demo featuring simple per-pixel diffuse/specular lighting using vertex/fragment shaders written in GLSL. It was created for the tutorial [Getting Started with the OpenGL Shading Language](http://joshbeam.com/articles/getting_started_with_glsl/) by [Josh Beam](https://github.com/joshb).

This program uses the [CMake](https://cmake.org/) build system. Run the following commands from the directory containing the source code to build and run the program:

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake .. && make
    ./glsl_lighting

This program is released under a BSD-style license. You can find the copyright notice and license conditions at the beginning of any of the source code files (such as main.c).
